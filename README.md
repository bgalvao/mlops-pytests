# MLOps PyTests

I wrote pytest scripts so you don't have to.

This is meant to be a cookiecutter - a starting point for you to configure your tests as you need them.

To generate these tests, cd to your project and run:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:bgalvao/mlops-pytests
```

## Roadmap

- [x] added [Deepchecks](https://deepchecks.com)

Other tests from other MLOps oriented packages may be added.
